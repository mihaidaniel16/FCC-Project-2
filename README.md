# FCC-Project-2

This is the second project of the freecodecamp's Responsive Web Design Curriculum
In this project I tried to implement a survey for a company that wanted to know more about its Customers.
I used a lot of HTML syntax and I learnt a lot about the mandatory requirements that a survey needs.
